# Sample Hackathon Schedule

Your Hackathon schedule will vary greatly depending on how long you are planning for your day and what your theme/prompt/activity is. The things we recommend most are:

* 'Chunk' the day - have clearly defined code sprints. Integrated breaks, games, or other activities between them so participants don't burn out.
* Encourage brainstorming time before actual work begins. If students have mentors, they may need sign off before they begin their projects.
* Incorporate feedback sessions whenever possible, or other moments for teams to step back and examine their work.
* Set clear expectations for each section of the day, including what can reasonable be expected to be accomplished.

**A sample schedule may look something like:**

* **8:30 - 9:00:** Entry, breakfast, get settled in teams
* **9:00 - 9:20:** Welcome, norms framing, prompt
* **9:20 - 9:45:** Brainstorming, mentor check-in
