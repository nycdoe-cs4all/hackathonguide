We do our best to bring you high-quality materials and curriculum, but we are a small team with other tasks than just material and curriculum development. That being said, there are likely things - content, links, typos - that we have missed, and if you found them, we would love to hear about them!

Please use the link below to provide any feedback - from found errors to requests to things you've enjoyed - and we will do our best to remedy and get back to you as quickly as possible.
