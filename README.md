# ðŸ’» CS4All Guide to Running a Hackathon

### What's a Hackathon?

A Hackathon does not involve any actual hacking - just coding! A Hackathon is a coding event/competition in which teams of people (in this case, students) work together to create a working prototype for a challenge prompt in a single day. Some Hackathons will include a learning component where students are taught a quick skill or platform to use in their projects, while others are simply about brainstorming and creating. Itâ€™s entirely okay that students donâ€™t leave with a completely finished product, the goal is prototyping.

Hackathons are fun, high energy events that can help students get excited about computer science, and they also happen in college and industry CS spaces. Some Hackathons even come with swag and/or prizes which is always cause for excitement.
